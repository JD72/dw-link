The idea is to test dw-probe on almost all possible targets sort
of semi-automatically. The tests consist of the unit tests and additional
gdb sessions on different programs, which are sort of blackbox tests.

The different programs are:
- the modified blink program, testing also breakpoints in ISRs
- the game of tictactoe adapted to a serial interface with a fixed
  seed for the random generator so that the game play is deterministic
- a recursive version of the Fibonacci function together with its
  memoizing version (arrays!) with array bound violations
- a basic version of OOP using geometric objects
- an example with illegal instructions (assembler with .word instructions)

All of it is compiled with arduino-cli and then debugged with avr-gdb using pexpect. 

Open questions:
 - how to deal with 16 MHz for non-ATmega chips
 - whether to include 16u2 by using one of the USBco-MCUs on an UNO board.
