# dw-gdbserver

This is an Arduino sketch that turns your Uno or Nano into a hardware debugger that uses the [debugWIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DebugWIRE) protocol. It acts as a gdbserver to avr-gdb, and so you can use it to debug your programs using avr-gdb or any IDE that intergrates avr-gdb, e.g., PlatformIO.
