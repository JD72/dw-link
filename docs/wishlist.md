# Wish list for dw-link

* a mode where reads & writes are double-checked: "monitor
  verify/noverify". Could be on or off by default.
* implement simple ISP programmer (again)
* using unused serial interface on Arduino Mega board -- if it works now!
* perhaps make conditional/repeating breakpoints faster: less register saving/restoring (would give you perhaps 10 ms out of 40 ms), shorter pauses by GDB (but where to control this?)
