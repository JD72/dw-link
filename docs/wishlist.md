# Wish list for dw-link

* a mode where reads & writes are double-checked: "monitor
  verify/noverify". Could be on or off by default.
* design of a shield
* support of clock speeds of 128 kHz
* monitor command for setting 128 kHz clock source
* implement simple ISP programmer again
* implement slow ISP fuse programming (2 kHz), perhaps as a fallback
* connection without reset (if DW is already enabled)
* recovery for RAM and flash read and flash programming errors
* port to 32U4 boards, such as Pro Micro, Leonardo, etc., perhaps
  making use of the serial interface as an input channel
