## Wish list

Some possible extensions:

* a mode where reads & writes are double-checked: "monitor
  verify/noverify". Could be on or off by default.
* PCB revision (smaller, solder-bridge for Pro Micro)
* design of a shield
* monitor command for setting 128 kHz clock source
* implement simple ISP programmer again
* implement slow ISP fuse programming (2 kHz), perhaps as a fallback
* connection without reset (if DW is already enabled)
* recovery for RAM and flash read and flash programming errors
